# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This project is under active development and not yet publicly released. Security fixes are handled on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security vulnerabilities privately to security@listion.app. Do not open public issues for security reports.

To help us triage effectively, include:
- A clear, reproducible description (steps and/or PoC)
- Affected commit/version and environment details
- Potential impact and suggested mitigations if known

We acknowledge reports within 48 hours and will keep you informed about the status and timeline. If a fix requires coordinated disclosure, we will work with you on an appropriate timeline.

## Scope
- Application server (backend) and exposed API endpoints
- Frontend build and client-side logic impacting security

Out of scope: third-party services not maintained by the Listion team.

## Public Disclosure
Please give us reasonable time to investigate and fix issues before any public disclosure. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters if desired.
